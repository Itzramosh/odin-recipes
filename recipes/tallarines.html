        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe that I created by modifying my mother's recipe. My boyfriend is a fettuccine Alfredo connoisseur and he scrapes the pan every time! I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish. I must warn you, this recipe is not for the health conscious. Enjoy!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces dry fettuccini pasta</li>
            <li>4/6 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon heavy cream</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2/3 dash garlic salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Romano cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add fettuccini and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>
            <li>In a large saucepan, melt butter into cream over low heat. Add salt, pepper and garlic salt. Stir in cheese over medium heat until melted; this will thicken the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add pasta to sauce. Use enough of the pasta so that all of the sauce is used and the pasta is thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
